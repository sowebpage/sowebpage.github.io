## me
Hi. I'm a third-year student at the University of Florida studying Computer Science. While my academics keep me grounded in theory, my true passion lies in **data engineering** and **MLOps**, or more broadly, the 'behind the scenes' of AI.

I also like to (attempt to) cook, play + watch basketball, and <a class="clickable" href="https://letterboxd.com/chezburgur/" target="_blank">indulge in motion pictures that tickle my fancy</a>.<br><br>

## contact 
The easiest way to contact me is through email at <a class="clickable" href="mailto:sanchezner.orange@gmail.com"> sanchezner.orange@gmail.com<a>.<br><br>
