## me
Hi. I'm a third-year student at the University of Florida studying Computer Science. While my academics keep me grounded in theory, my true passion lies in **data engineering** and **MLOps**, or more broadly, the 'behind the scenes' of AI.

I also like to (attempt to) cook, play + watch basketball, and [indulge in motion pictures that tickle my fancy](https://letterboxd.com/chezburgur/ {target=_blank}).<br><br>

## contact 
The easiest way to contact me is through email at [sanchezner.orange@gmail.com](mailto:sanchezner.orange@gmail.com).<br><br>
